monitAIR RaspberryPi Node for connectedhumber.org

Start with Raspbian Lite image https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
currently 'Rasbian Stretch' November 2018

Install python modules as needed, some may already be installed.

Compile Bosch BSEC and copy bsec_bme680, bsec_iaq.config bsec_iaq.state (filname-1) empty file placeholder for reference only
   
Currently v2.4.7.2 https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/bst/products/all_products/bsec

SDS021 or SDS011 on GPIO uart.
Initialise with 
sudo raspi-config.
- Interface options
-- Enable Serial
--- No to Console
--- Yes to Port
(reboot or contntinue to I2C setup)

BME680 on I2C, 3V3 & GND
Initialise with
sudo raspi-config
- Interface options
-- I2C Enable
(reboot)

SDS021 should be able to plug directly into pysical pins 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 with white connector, use empty spot at gpio-pin2. 
(5V, 5V, GND, RXD from SDS, TXD from SDS)
Double check this is correct for your SDS021.
Check for SDS011 wiring setup

BME680
Use pysical pins 1, 3, 5, 9 (3V3, SDA, SCL, GND)

GNNS - Ublox M8030, use USB varient. no aditional setup need. 
check with lsusb on ttyACM0 or ttyUSB0 if using a different GNSS

DS18B20 on pysical pins 4 (data wire), 14 (VCC/3V3) and 17 (GND)
~4k7 resistor between pin4 and 3V3
